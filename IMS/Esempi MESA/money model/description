The tutorial model is a very simple simulated agent-based economy, drawn from econophysics and presenting a statistical mechanics approach to wealth distribution [Dragulescu2002]_. The rules of our tutorial model:

There are some number of agents.
All agents begin with 1 unit of money.

At every step of the model, an agent gives 1 unit of money (if they have it) to some other agent.
Despite its simplicity, this model yields results that are often unexpected to those not familiar with it.
